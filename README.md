Minimum Python version needed to run: 3.10+

Required libraries: prettytable and prompt_toolkit
They can be installed either with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
or by running the commands "pip install prettytable" and "pip install prompt_toolkit"

The file "gendata.py" can be used to recreate the original example data in case of data mishaps.

Our testing was conducted on Windows and MacOS and we don't guarantee that other operating
systems will function correctly.

We ran the program both directly as "main.py" and as "python main.py" and those both
worked.
